oh I find-a, when I sleep-a
melodies I, sow and reap of
nectar sweet and the honey sweeter
from my lungs into the speaker
tiger, I don't need yah
i will follow, my own lead down
to the river, as I seek-a

tiger balm
let me sleep with thunder
keep me calm
as we breathe in colors
spread your legs
wild and fateful flower
bloom in the gloom
bloom in the gloom

freaky boy
feed me sweet banana
shut my eyes
lead me through habana
serpents tongue
laced with fragrant nectar
oh temptation abouds
hypnotic, gracious and proud

oh I find-a, when I sleep-a
melodies I, sow and reap of
nectar sweet and the honey sweeter
from my lungs into the speaker
tiger, I don't need yah
i will follow, my own lead down
to the river, as I seek-a

tiger balm
help and hide my fear
keep me calm
as the fates appear
hide my face
in your fragrant flower
bloom in the gloom
bloom in the gloom

freaky gyal
wonâ€™t you be my bassline
shut my eyes
as we sip the daylight
serpent's tongue
tells two different stories
oh temptation abounds
hypnotic, fatal and proud

oh I find-a, when I sleep-a
melodies I, sow and reap of
nectar sweet and the honey sweeter
from my lungs into the speaker
tiger, I don't need yah
i will follow, my own lead down
to the river, as I seek-a

oh I find-a, when I sleep-a
melodies I, sow and reap of
nectar sweet and the honey sweeter
from my lungs into the speaker
tiger, I don't need yah
i will follow, my own lead down
to the river, as I seek-a
